# LinkAce - Engineering Overview

LinkAce is a self-hosted bookmark management application designed to help users archive, organize, and share web links with advanced features beyond traditional browser bookmarks. Built with Laravel (PHP) and modern web technologies, it provides a robust, personalized database for curating and managing online discoveries.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

LinkAce addresses the limitations of browser bookmarks by providing:

Long-term preservation: Automated archiving via Internet Archive prevents link rotAdvanced organization: Multi-dimensional categorization using lists and tagsLink health monitoring: Automated checking for broken or moved linksCollaborative sharing: Multi-user support with internal sharing capabilitiesCross-platform access: Full REST API and integrations with 2500+ apps via ZapierPrivacy control: Granular visibility settings (public, internal, private)

## Intended Users

LinkAce targets several user personas:

Researchers and academics who need to maintain organized reference collectionsProfessionals curating industry resources and knowledge basesTeams and organizations sharing curated link collections internallyPower users who want more control and features than browser bookmarks providePrivacy-conscious individuals seeking self-hosted alternatives to cloud bookmark services

## High-Level Architecture

LinkAce is a **Laravel 10-based monolithic application** following MVC architecture patterns. The backend uses PHP 8.1+ with a relational database (MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL), Redis for caching/queues, and a modern frontend built with Bootstrap 5 and Tom-Select. The application follows Laravel best practices with dedicated layers for Actions, Repositories, Jobs, and API resources, and ships as Docker containers for simplified deployment.
