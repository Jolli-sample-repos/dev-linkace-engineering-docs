# LinkAce - Engineering Overview

LinkAce is a self-hosted bookmark management application designed to help users archive, organize, and share web links with advanced features beyond traditional browser bookmarks. Built with Laravel (PHP) and modern web technologies, it provides a robust, personalized database for curating and managing online discoveries.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

LinkAce addresses the limitations of browser bookmarks by providing:

- **Long-term preservation**: Automated archiving via Internet Archive prevents link rot
- **Advanced organization**: Multi-dimensional categorization using lists and tags
- **Link health monitoring**: Automated checking for broken or moved links
- **Collaborative sharing**: Multi-user support with internal sharing capabilities
- **Cross-platform access**: Full REST API and integrations with 2500+ apps via Zapier
- **Privacy control**: Granular visibility settings (public, internal, private)

## Intended Users

LinkAce targets several user personas:

- **Researchers and academics** who need to maintain organized reference collections
- **Professionals** curating industry resources and knowledge bases
- **Teams and organizations** sharing curated link collections internally
- **Power users** who want more control and features than browser bookmarks provide
- **Privacy-conscious individuals** seeking self-hosted alternatives to cloud bookmark services

## High-Level Architecture

LinkAce is a **Laravel 10-based monolithic application** following MVC architecture patterns. The backend uses PHP 8.1+ with a relational database (MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL), Redis for caching/queues, and a modern frontend built with Bootstrap 5 and Tom-Select. The application follows Laravel best practices with dedicated layers for Actions, Repositories, Jobs, and API resources, and ships as Docker containers for simplified deployment.

Key architectural components:
- **Backend**: Laravel 10 framework with PHP 8.1+
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL support
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis for performance and background jobs
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 + Tom-Select (server-side rendering)
- **API**: RESTful API with Laravel Sanctum authentication
- **Deployment**: Docker-based with multi-architecture support (amd64, arm64, arm/v7)

## Project Maturity & Stability

### Maturity Indicators

**Production-Ready (v2.x)**: LinkAce recently released version 2.0, indicating a major milestone in maturity. Current version is 2.4.1.

**Well-Structured Codebase**:
- Comprehensive test suite with PHPUnit
- Code quality monitoring via Codacy
- Standardized code style (PHP_CodeSniffer)
- Clear separation of concerns (Actions, Repositories, Policies)
- Dependency management via Composer and NPM

**Enterprise-Grade Features**:
- Security advisories monitoring (Roave)
- Error tracking integration (Sentry)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Database backup strategies
- Multi-database support

**Active Development**:
- Regular releases tracked on GitHub
- Community discussions forum
- Crowdin for translations (community-driven)
- Open Collective/Patreon support model
- Comprehensive documentation site

**Deployment Options**:
- Docker Compose (production and development)
- Native PHP installation
- Kubernetes support (Beta)
- One-click cloud deployments
- Managed hosting (Beta waitlist)

### Areas to Note

- **Version 2.0 is recent**: While feature-rich, the v2.x branch represents a significant upgrade from v1.x. Teams should review the upgrade guide and test thoroughly.
- **Community support model**: Free support is community-driven via GitHub Discussions; dedicated support requires sponsorship.
- **Kubernetes support is Beta**: Production Kubernetes deployments should be evaluated carefully.
